I made this website for my mum's independent dance business 

I asked her to tell me what she wanted written in each section

I had a look at some outside tutorials for some of the CSS used (e.g. the hero image) so I'm not sure if it's 100% correct 

I had some trouble with file corruption on my original repo, so I've had to copy and paste what was on my old repo into my new one. This is why there isn't a constant stream of commits. Sorry about this!
